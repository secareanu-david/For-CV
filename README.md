# Webpage

A highschool project I made using HTML and CSS.

The main page is on 'prezentare.html' . I tried to summarise every important aspect of the game League of Legends on there. 
Next, by clicking on 'CAMPIONI' on the top-left side of the page, you will see frames for every champion (character) in League of Legends at the point of creating this project.
You can sort the champions by their roles.
If u click on a champion frame, you will get redirected to their own page, where you can see their abilities ( Passive, Q, W, E, R ) by clicking on their icon. A video will be played on the right side of the page.
